# PhotoSync

Simple app to sync contents from a media device (such as an iPhone) to another storage location.

This library makes use of a wonderful library from @Bassman2 called [MediaDevices](https://github.com/Bassman2/MediaDevices).  

## Operation

It's simple: build and run!  The app will display a list of detected media devices, then queue each discovered directory, and copy to a location you specify.
